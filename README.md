# Hey Visitors
Hello everyoone ! Welcome to my dsa code sheets.
It is here that I understand and solve strivers dsa sheet and implement the java and python codes.

## Programs Done till now
- Sort 0 ,1,and 2 in order with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
- Find the missing and repeating numbers in an array.Implemented this using hashmaps although other 
notable solutions include -- summing up using n(n+1)/2 and n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 ..and using them to find missing and repeating ellements.
